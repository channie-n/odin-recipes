           <p> this simple but delicious pasta recipe is so quick and easy to make, especially on night when your running low on food or too tired to cook a full meal. It can also be easily customized to your liking! (the fresher the ingredients, the better!) </p>
   <h3> Ingredients You'll Need:</h3>
       <ul>
           <li> 12 oz spaghetti</li>
           <li> ½ to 1 cup pasta water</li>
           <li> ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
           <li> 4 garlic cloves, <em> thinly sliced</em></li>
           <li> ¼ to ½ tsp of red pepper flakes</li>
           <li> 1 large bunch lacinato kale, stemmed and chopped</li>
           <li> ½ tsp of sea salt</li>
           <li> freshly ground black pepper</li>
           <li> 1 tsp of lemon zest</li>
           <li> ⅓ cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
           <li> Parmesan for serving</li>
      
       </ul>
   <h3> The Steps:</h3>
       <ol>
          <li> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Prepare the pasta according to the package instructions, cooking until al dente. Reserve 1 cup of the pasta cooking water before draining the pasta.</li>
          <li> Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes. Stir and cook for 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until the garlic is lightly browned around the edges. Add the kale, salt, and several grinds of pepper and cook, tossing with tongs, until the kale is wilted, up to 1 minute.</li> 
          <li> Add the spaghetti and toss to combine. Add ½ cup pasta water and the lemon juice and zest and toss. If the pasta is seeming too dry, add the remaining ½ cup pasta water to create a light sauce.</li>
          <li> Season to taste. Garnish with parsley and serve with Parmesan. </li>
       </ol>
