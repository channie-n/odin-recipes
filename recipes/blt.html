   <h3> Ingredients You'll Need:</h3>
       <ul>
           <li> 2 slices thick slices hearty white bread</li>
           <li> 4 tsp of butter, soft</li>
           <li> 3 tbsp mayonnaise OR other sauce (like an aioli)</li>
           <li> 4 slices thin cut bacon</li>
           <li> 2-4 pieces green leaf lettuce</li>
           <li> 1 perfectly ripe tomato</li>
           <li> 1/2 perfectly ripe avocado (optional)</li>
           <li> salt & pepper</li>
       </ul>  
   <h3> The Steps:</h3>
       <ol>
           <li> Start by frying(or baking) your bacon. When the bacon is crispy (but not TOO crispy!) take it out and remove to a paper-towel lined plate. Tear each slice of bacon in half so there are 8 strips. Keep warm until ready to assemble.</li>
           <li> While the bacon is cooking, prepare your bread. Spread both sides of your bread with butter. Place in a skillet over medium heat and toast lightly, it will only take a couple minutes. Flip each piece of bread and toast the other side.Set aside.</li>
           <li> Wash and dry your green leaf lettuce. Slice your tomato into slices that are about 3/8 inch thick. Place the tomatoes on a paper towel-lined plate so absorb some of the water.</li>
           <li> Cut your avocado in half, then slice one half into strips.</li>
           <li>Assemble your sandwich: Spread about 1 and 1/2 tablespoons mayonnaise* on your toasted bread. Top with lettuce fronds. Next add 2 tomato slices that have been sitting on a paper towel for at least a few minutes. Sprinkle your tomatoes with salt and pepper. </li>
           <li> Add all the bacon. </li>
           <li> Top the bacon with avocado strips. Sprinkle with a little more salt and pepper, if you like.</li>
           <li> Spread the other piece of toasted bread with mayonnaise or whatever sauce you are using. Top the sandwich and gently press down. Use a sharp serrated knife to slice the sandwich in half. This recipe makes 1 amazing sandwich. Eat right away!</li>
